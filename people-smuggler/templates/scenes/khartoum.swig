		<p class="scene__text">The start of many migrantsâ€™ journeys to Europe. A bustling metropolitan area of over five million people that is a magnet for refugees fleeing conflict in neighbouring countries. Many migrants meet their handlers at the Omdurman Market and negotiate a price for the first stage of their journey north. But for many, they'll never reach Europe.</p>
