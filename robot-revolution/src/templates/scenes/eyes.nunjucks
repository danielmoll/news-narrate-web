  Vision is where robots offer an edge on humans. Like us, they can use two colour cameras working together so that they can perceive depth. But they can do a lot more too: infrared, radar, sonar and lasers can all help them perceive the world.
</p>
<p class="scene__text">
  The tricky part for robots, unlike humans, is identifying object - thatâ€™s why many robotic vision system use a combination of vision techniques, for instance combining a high speed stereoscopic camera with a slower laser scanner, which builds a 3D map of the world.
