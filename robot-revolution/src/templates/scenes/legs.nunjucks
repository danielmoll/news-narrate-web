  Walking is hard. Like humans, robots don’t rely just on legs. The Walk-Man, created by the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, is a ‘whole-body’ system, its eyes, arms, hands and legs work together to walk smoothly(ish).
</p>
<p class="scene__text">
  The legs are pliant, rather than rigid, making balance easier and sensors in its feet feel Walk-Man how its weight is distributed. It is still nowhere near as nimble as a human, and requires a hefty power supply.
